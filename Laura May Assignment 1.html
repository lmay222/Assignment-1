<h2>History</h2>
<p>For this assignment I chose to investigate the British Library web page. I studied abroad in London as an undergraduate and I spent some time physically researching at the British Library. So, I wanted to look more into their online presence!</p>

<p>The British Library was created officially in 1973 following the British Library Act of 1972 and became the national library of the United Kingdom. Their collection includes documents from many older institutions all over England including the British Museums former library and private donations. Like the Library of Congress, the British Library also receives one copy of almost every book published in the United Kingdom and Ireland. It now has over 170 million items including books, newspapers, maps, sound recordings, stamps, and more.</p>

<p>All of this information for my background portion was accessed from from this <a href="https://www.cambridge.org/core/books/abs/cambridge-history-of-libraries-in-britain-and-ireland/british-library-and-its-antecedents/BCBDB51497800951133647F81D0A2377"> Journal</a>


<h3>Users</h3>

<p>Because the British Library holds most of the major physical works created in the U.K. researchers, students, and tourists from all over the world want to investigate the holdings that they have. Most of their website is catered to the people trying to work or explore the Library in-person. Because they are catering to a physical audience there is a significant need for navigable web pages to help people:</p>

	<li>and visit the physical spaces</li>

</ul>


<h4>Content</h4>

<p>To best serve their in-person populations of academics and tourists they need to have easy access to ways to research online as well as how to find things in person. For in person events, they have an event page. There you can access information about exhibitions they are showing, their opening times, and how to book. Under the research tab they have information about how to get a reader pass so you can go in person and study the documents they do not have available digitally. They also have a digital catalog where you can search their main catalog of books and other printed material. In 2023, the British Library was the subject of a major cyber-attack, so their online catalog took a major hit. They are still not fully back online, and they have not been able to upload any new records since April 2023. So, when you access their collection page it is labeled as their interim catalogue all still due to this cyber-attack. When I tried to use the search catalogue I searched for The Gutenberg Bible and found that their catalogue gave me the availability of the book, the author, the title, the date of publishing, and the ISBN. The web page then directed me to request the item using their online request form and my reader id number. While poking around I saw they had most of their books and printed documents available for request in their catalogue but none of their imaging or audio resources available on their website catalogue.</p>


<h5>Systems Discussion</h5>

<h6>Interesting Features</h6>

<p>This is a very uninteresting website. Their home page is very plain and has little to interact with besides a simple directory that send you to more pages. Their catalogue and request system are poor and directs you to a google form to input your information. I was shocked to see this, and I wonder if this is another impact of the cyber-attack. It does feel like a google form may not be the safest way to request information but if this is what they figured out in the meantime it must work for them. Overall, this is a very boring website.</p>


<h7>Pros and Cons of the System</h7>


<p>Pros:
It works very well for people trying to come in-person to explore their materials. They clearly have dedicated more time to their in-person experience and helping people prepare for coming to the space with all their materials already ordered and ready for them. Another pro is that with how simple the website is it is easy to find everything. They have not hidden the catalogue anywhere too confusing, and it is easy to navigate through what they have available. I will not be as harsh on them, again because of the cyber-attack, they have plenty of information everywhere about what things have changed in the wake of their issues.</p>

<p>Cons:
There is not much to see! As a user I did not want to spend any extra time on here. It did not encourage me to poke around any more than I needed to for this project and their features were very utilitarian. It also is obviously focused more on being the national library for the U.K. so there is not much you can access outside of visiting the physical building. That feels like such a missed opportunity. Many outside researchers would probably love to be able to access digitized versions of their documents to at least see Magna Carta or other groundbreaking documents, but I wonder if the access to that also became limited after the attack. I remember at one point being able to find images online and it is sad to imagine that because of this cyber-attack they had to remove all of that amazing content. We can only hope that eventually they can continue to upload those items soon.</p>


<h8>Suggestions for Improvement</h8>

<p>There is no way to communicate with them directly on the website. They send you to blog posts, Frequently Asked Questions, and other automated communication methods instead of allowing for a more interactive experience. I really wish there was a way to send a question to a librarian or at least ask questions to a chat bot on the website. Especially considering the cyber-attack. People clearly have questions about the safety of their information and how to access materials, and the website just directs you to send an email, which is not a very inviting way to interface with the library.</p>

<p>I also think there is an opportunity for more online availability of their collection. As I discussed in the pros and cons portion of this evaluation I remember a time where these items were more accessible, but if I am mistaken I hope that they create an online catalogue to browse at a later date.</p>
